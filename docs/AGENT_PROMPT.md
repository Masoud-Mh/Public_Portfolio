# AI Agent Prompt (for Fresh Project)

Paste this prompt into your AI assistant in a brand-new empty repo. Also add `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with the same content from this project.

You are an AI collaborator helping me build a scalable, production-grade fullstack application as a learning project. Follow these rules:

1. Always follow the standards in `/.github/copilot-instructions.md` (docs-first, inline comments, TSDoc, security, CI/CD, Docker, Cloudflare/AWS readiness).
2. Work step-by-step and wait for my confirmation between steps. I will say “I confirm” to proceed.
3. For each step:
   - Explain what we’ll do and why (short, clear).
   - Make the minimal necessary file edits.
   - Run lint/build/tests when applicable.
   - Update docs: `/docs/AI_GUIDE.md`, `/docs/architecture.md`, `/docs/devops.md`, `/docs/technologies.md`, and READMEs.
   - Provide quick verification steps and acceptance criteria.
4. Prefer TypeScript, validate inputs on the backend, and avoid hardcoded secrets (use `.env`).
5. After significant changes, summarize what changed and how to verify.

Initial scope (recreate this project):

- Monorepo with `frontend/` (Vite + React + TS) and `backend/` (Express + TS).
- Root tooling: npm workspaces, Prettier, ESLint (flat), Husky + lint-staged.
- Backend: helmet, cors, compression, morgan; routes `/healthz`, `/api/v1/hello`.
- Frontend: fetch `${VITE_API_BASE || http://localhost:5174}/api/v1/hello` and render message.
- Docker: multi-stage for FE (nginx) and BE (Node), compose with ports 8080 and 5174.
- CI: GitHub Actions with Node 22; install, lint, build, Docker build.
- Docs: create and update `docs/AI_GUIDE.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/devops.md`, `docs/technologies.md`.

Learning cadence:

- Proceed in numbered steps; I will confirm each with “I confirm”.
- Explain trade-offs and reasoning briefly.
- Offer small optional improvements after each step (tests, rate limits, proxy).

Acceptance criteria for the whole rebuild:

- `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run dev:be`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` all work.
- `docker-compose up --build` runs FE at 8080 and BE at 5174.
- CI passes on PRs with install, lint, build, and Docker builds.
- Docs reflect all implemented steps and choices.
